# ðŸ§° Simple TypeScript Starter | 2021

> We talk about a lot of **advanced Node.js and TypeScript** concepts on [the blog](https://khalilstemmler.com), particularly focused around Domain-Driven Design and large-scale enterprise application patterns. However, I received a few emails from readers that were interested in seeing what a basic TypeScript starter project looks like. So I've put together just that.

### Features

- Minimal
- TypeScript v4
- Testing with Jest
- Linting with Eslint and Prettier

### Scripts

#### `npm run test`

Runs the `jest` tests once.
